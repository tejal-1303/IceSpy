# IceSpy
A novel neural network used to classify iceberg images, returned an accuracy of 87%-90%


Icebergs pose a serious threat to transportation, oil and gas production facilities, and pipelines within. Information about icebergs and islands is important for atmospheric research and the different oceans in marine areas. Detection and tracking of frozen objects in mostly dark and cloudy areas are done using a proven instrument called Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

In this project, a deep learning method-based CNN is used to distinguish icebergs from high-resolution satellite images. This project presents a robust and efficient method for extracting features for SAR object distribution using deep data. This method is based on the principle of adaptability and aims to improve the performance of uncertain environments that vary widely in texture, softness, size, and shape.

Used a Convolutional Neural Network with 4 neural layers and 3 fully connected layers.
